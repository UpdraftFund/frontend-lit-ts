## [Vite](https://vite.dev/) workflow.

1. `git clone` the project and `cd` into it.
2. `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. `yarn dev` to deploy the test site to your browser. Any changes you do will be hotloaded and immediately visible in your browser.
4. Before you `git push` your changes, do `yarn build` to make sure there are no type errors. If there are no errors, then pushing to `dev` (or creating a PR that merges into `dev`) will automatically create a preview site so other people can see your changes.
